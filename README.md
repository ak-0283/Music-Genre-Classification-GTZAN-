# üéµ Music Recommendation & Analysis System

A **music-focused application** that recommends songs, analyzes audio features, and provides an interactive experience for users. Built using **Python and machine learning**, this project combines **data analysis**, **feature extraction**, and **recommendation algorithms** to enhance music discovery.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Music Recommendation:** Suggests songs based on user preferences or audio similarity.
* **Audio Feature Analysis:** Extracts features like tempo, beats, pitch, and mood.
* **Interactive Interface:** Users can search for songs, get recommendations, and visualize music attributes.
* **Data Visualization:** Insights about genre distribution, tempo trends, and popularity metrics.
* **Scalable Design:** Can be extended to include playlists, collaborative filtering, or deep learning models.

---

## üìä Dataset

* Dataset includes songs with attributes like **genre, tempo, duration, key, loudness, and popularity**.
* Preprocessing involved **handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical data**.
* Public datasets sourced from **Kaggle, Spotify API, or other open music datasets**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Programming:** Python
* **Data Analysis & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, librosa, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Optional Frontend:** Streamlit / Flask for web interface
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git & GitHub

## üß† Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**

   * Collected music datasets, cleaned data, normalized numeric features, encoded categorical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualized genre distributions, popularity trends, and feature correlations.
3. **Feature Extraction**

   * Used **librosa** to extract tempo, chroma, spectral features from audio files.
4. **Model Building**

   * Implemented recommendation algorithms (content-based filtering, similarity-based).
   * Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and similarity scores.
5. **User Interface**

   * Simple interface to query songs and display recommendations with features.
